# Build an ML Pipeline for Short-Term Rental Prices in NYC

A complete machine learning pipeline for predicting short-term rental prices in New York City using MLflow, Weights & Biases, and scikit-learn.

## Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end ML pipeline that:
- Downloads and preprocesses Airbnb rental data
- Performs data validation and quality checks
- Trains a Random Forest regression model
- Evaluates model performance on test data
- Tracks experiments and artifacts using W&B

- **GitHub Repository**: [Project-Build-an-ML-Pipeline-Starter](https://github.com/aliceklink/Project-Build-an-ML-Pipeline-Starter)

## Pipeline Architecture

The pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Download** (`download`): Fetches raw data samples
2. **Data Cleaning** (`basic_cleaning`): Removes outliers and filters geographic boundaries
3. **Data Validation** (`data_check`): Performs statistical tests and quality checks
4. **Data Splitting** (`data_split`): Creates train/validation/test splits
5. **Model Training** (`train_random_forest`): Trains Random Forest with optimized hyperparameters
6. **Model Testing** (`test_regression_model`): Evaluates final model performance

## Model Performance

### Best Model Results
- **Model**: Random Forest (solar-firefly-24)
- **Validation MAE**: 32.70
- **Validation RÂ²**: 0.558
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - n_estimators: 200
  - max_depth: 50
  - min_samples_split: 4
  - min_samples_leaf: 3

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10
- Conda
- MLflow
- Weights & Biases account

### Running the Complete Pipeline

```bash
# Run the latest release
mlflow run https://github.com/aliceklink/Project-Build-an-ML-Pipeline-Starter.git \
           -v 1.0.0 \
           -P hydra_options="etl.sample='sample1.csv'"

# Run with different data
mlflow run https://github.com/aliceklink/Project-Build-an-ML-Pipeline-Starter.git \
           -v 1.0.0 \
           -P hydra_options="etl.sample='sample2.csv'"
```

### Running Individual Steps

```bash
# Run only specific steps
mlflow run . -P steps=download,basic_cleaning

# Run with custom parameters
mlflow run . -P hydra_options="modeling.random_forest.n_estimators=300"
```

## Configuration

Key configuration parameters in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
etl:
  min_price: 10        # Minimum price filter
  max_price: 350       # Maximum price filter

modeling:
  test_size: 0.2       # Test set proportion
  val_size: 0.2        # Validation set proportion
  random_seed: 42      # Reproducibility seed
  
  random_forest:
    n_estimators: 200  # Optimized value
    max_depth: 50      # Optimized value
```
